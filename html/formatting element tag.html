	<p> <b>Kalam</b> <b>was</b><i> invited by</i><em> Raja</em><abbr title="1"> Ramanna</abbr> <small>to witness the country's first nuclear test</small><mark> Smiling Buddha as the </mark><strike>representative of TBRL,</strike><ins> even though he had not participated</ins> in<sub> its</sub> development. In the 1970s, Kalam also<sup> directed </sup><del>two projects, Project </del>Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet,<big> Prime Minister </big>Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing<u> the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.</u>[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.[29] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[30][31]
