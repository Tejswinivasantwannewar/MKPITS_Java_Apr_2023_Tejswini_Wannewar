	<h3>During a pandemic, a government cannot be permitted to undermine hard-won democratic rights
</h3>
<p> While the economic cost of the pandemic has been discussed widely, not as much attention has been paid to the lurking danger of the shrinking of democratic spaces. The most explicit manifestation of this global malaise can be seen in Hungary now, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán recently secured parliamentary approval for a set of draconian measures including jail terms for spreading misinformation and no clear time limit to a state of emergency that allows him to rule by decree. The Opposition parties’ demand for a sunset clause on the legislation was brushed aside by the ruling party, which has a brute majority in parliament.<br><br>
	The editorial in this newspaper, “Uncritical endorsement” (April 2), pointed out how the Indian Supreme Court has uncritically accepted the official narrative that “fake news” about the duration of the lockdown being “three months” caused a panic reaction from migrant workers across States.<br> As the editorial said, neither the Court nor the government acknowledged the real factors such as “the short notice of just four hours for the lockdown to take effect, the lack of planning and coordination with the States, the fears of the people about being left without cash and running out of food, and worries about their families back home.” In the same case, the Union government sought a direction to restrain the media from reporting or publishing “anything” without ascertaining the factual position from the government. It was an Indian Orbán moment where only the official version, however limited the information may be and with its inherent elements of propaganda, would have legal sanction.<br><br>Exceptional situations require exceptional measures. Faced with the magnitude of the health risks caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, national governments have had to quickly decide whether or not to declare a state of emergency to curb the spread of the disease.
Where a health threat constitutes a danger for the whole population, then the suspension of ordinary law is legitimate to increase the government's capacity to protect society. A state of necessity justifies the state of emergency. This state provides a legal framework for the limitation of individual freedom during a short period of time, such as the freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, and entrepreneurial freedom. This state enables governments to requisition goods and services, to shut down public or private facilities, and to take binding measures that would normally be seen as infringements of basic rights. Health security becomes a matter of public security.<br> <br>
<h3>• Can a virus undermine human rights?
</h3>

Exceptional situations require exceptional means. Faced with an imminent threat, governments do not hesitate to use the latest mass surveillance technologies.1 China is making use of drones, facial recognition cameras, and Quick Response code technology to monitor the whereabouts of its citizens. South Korea, Singapore, and Israel are extracting Global Positioning System data from mobile phone networks, credit card information, and video images to monitor the outbreak. These countries exercise an intrusive biopolitics where everybody can be watched, screened, and monitored in their every movement. Although such observation from a distance is effective in containing COVID-19, there is little knowledge on how these data will be stored over the long term and how tempting it will be for governments to maintain increased amounts of surveillance in the aftermath of the pandemic.<br>
Can exceptionality jeopardise some democratic principles in the long term? Could the epidemic lead to a reduction of individual rights after the peak of the crisis? The first risk is that some exceptional measures adopted in the context of an emergency might eventually fall within the scope of ordinary legislation, if leaders argue that a widespread health threat could resurface at any time. In the USA, the Patriot Act has infringed on civil liberties in the long run by allowing security agencies to spy on every American without due process. In France, after the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, an anti-terrorism law reduced civil liberties by curtailing judicial oversight of security tools. Many intellectuals argue that such normalisation of emergency measures has become a trend in democracies<br><br><hr>
